    "This data set is a collection of information about 138,000 Youtube videos that span several different categories. We know that certain videos are more or less likely to appear as “trending” on Youtube. We also know that this can seriously impact the view numbers, and so the revenue generated from these videos. We also know that advertisers want to advertise on videos that are less controversial and/or of higher quality and we believe that using the like/dislike ratio of a video is a good way to understand that metric. So far, it is difficult to find other similar projects since YouTube analytics is its own tool through YouTube. If we do find one later, we can always reference its findings compared to our own. \n",
